# Waydroid Guide
Hello ü§≠. In this guide, you will be informed about what is Waydroid, how to install and configure it in a beginner friendly way.
## Questions
**What is Waydroid?**
- [Waydroid](https://waydro.id/) is a container-based compatibility layer that enables Android to run in a containerized environment on Linux systems. You can use your favourite Android applications and play a good amount of Android games through Waydroid.
**How does Waydroid differ from Android emulators?**
- Mobile phones have processors that use **ARM-based** architecture while most of the computers have processors that use **x86_64** architecture.
  - So, Android emulators **emulate (imitate)** everything about the Android system software-side to make Android applications and games run on computers and this process delivers **naturally poor** performance especially if you do not have a powerful system.
    - To explain further, Android emulators emulate:
      - **CPU Architecture:** They emulate **ARM** CPU architecture instead of using your CPU architecture natively.
      - **Android System Services and Kernel:** They emulate Android's kernel components in a virtual environment.
      - **Device Hardware and Sensors**
        - GPS
        - Compass sensor, gyroscope, magnetometer etc.
        - Camera, microphone and speakers
        - Wi-Fi and telephony functions like phone calls, SMS etc.
        - Storage
        - GPU rendering
        - Keyboard, mouse, controllers etc.
  - However, Waydroid **does not imitate** anything mentioned above but it directly uses **your own computer hardware and Linux kernel** to run Android on Linux. That's why there is **almost no performance loss**.
  - Plus, just like how WINE directs Windows library files into Linux library files to make Windows applications run on Linux, Waydroid performs a similar process for directing Android library files into Linux library files for software compatibility.
**Can I play all Android games through Waydroid?**
- No. Most of the Android games do not support x86_64 architecture. It is possible to install an **ARM translation layer** to make incompatible games compatible, however if that game does not support keyboard + mouse configuration, you will be unable to play the game anyway.
  - Some Android games that support keyboard + mouse configuration are:
    - Roblox
    - Minecraft: Pocket Edition
    - Subway Surfers
    - aa (and derivatives)
    - Stardew Valley
    - Asphalt 8
    - Geometry Dash
    - Shadow Fight 3
 - Other than that, many Android games like **Angry Birds, Stick Hero etc.** that only require a touchscreen can be played through your mouse.
 - It is also possible to get keyboard + mouse compatibility for games that do not support it through keymappers. However, I am not knowledgeable enough to include it in my guide. I might include it later if I can succeed using it.
## Before Starting
Before starting, I must say that Waydroid runs **only on Wayland!!!** So if you are using X11, you should apply some extra steps.
## Get Started - Wayland
- First of all, install Waydroid [following the steps according to your Linux distribution](https://docs.waydro.id/usage/install-on-desktops).
- Next, execute `sudo waydroid init` command in your terminal to install Android in Waydroid.
- Next, install [this script](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script) to configure Waydroid easier.
  - If you are confused, [install the required dependency package for your Linux distribution](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies) first and [execute the specified commands in your terminal](https://github.com/casualsnek/waydroid_script?tab=readme-ov-file#interactive-terminal-interface) to run the script.
- After successfully running the script, follow these steps:
  - `Android 11 - Install - Choose "microg and libhoudini (or libndk if you use an AMD CPU)" using Space button - Enter - Select "Standard" as the MicroG variant`
- After these steps, you are officially ready to use Waydroid.
## How to Run Waydroid on X11?
- Simply apply the previous steps to install Waydroid properly.
- After applying the previous steps, install `weston` package using your package manager.
- Next, create a file and name it whatever you want. Change the file's extension as `.sh` and open the file using a text editor.
  - Your bash script's content should be:
```
#!/bin/bash

WAYLAND_DISPLAY=waydroid-1 weston --socket=waydroid-1 --backend=x11-backend.so --width=1280 --height=720 &
sleep 3
waydroid session start
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=waydroid-1 waydroid show-full-ui
```
If you want, you can change the `--width` and `--height` values according to your liking.
- After saving the changes, move the file to a location that you will be able to remember the path of.
- Next, open terminal in that location and give your file the necessary permissions by executing the command below:
  - `sudo chmod +x yourfile.sh`
- Now we have the script that will automatically launch Waydroid on X11 without issues. However, running `./yourfile.sh` command every time you want to use Waydroid can be annoying. That's why, let's make it look like an app!
- Create a file with `.desktop` file extension and open it using a text editor.
  - Your file's content should be:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Waydroid-X11
Comment=Launch Waydroid inside Weston
Exec=sh -c '~/waydroid.sh'
Icon=waydroid
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=System;
```
After saving the changes, move the file to the necessary location to make your system detect it as an application executing the command below:
- `sudo mv yourfile.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/`
- After that, you should see an app called **Waydroid-X11** in your applications list. You can comfortably start launching waydroid using that shortcut on X11!
## Waydroid Hybrid Graphics Setup
- Waydroid does not run on hybrid graphics (computers with two GPUs) setup. So that's why we should make Waydroid use our integrated GPU.
- To do so, execute `sudo nano /var/lib/waydroid/waydroid_base.prop` command in terminal and change these two as:
```
ro.hardware.gralloc=default
ro.hardware.egl=mesa
```
After saving the changes, close Waydroid by executing `waydroid session stop` command in terminal and try launching it again. The problem should be solved.
## Post Installation
- First of all, the store application we will be using is **Aurora Store** and not Play Store. Do not worry, Aurora Store can install everything that Play Store can.
- Next, for MicroG configuration, open **microG Settings** app and:
  - Enable `Google device registration`, `Cloud Messaging` and `Google SafetyNet`.
- After these steps, you can finally start downloading your favourite software!
- When you close Waydroid, it generally keeps running in the background. If you would like to stop it from running in the background, you should execute the command below:
  - `waydroid session stop`
### A Little Note After Installation
- On your Linux system, you might see the Android apps inside Waydroid on your applications list and you might find seeing them annoying. To hide them:
  - Go to `~/.local/share/applications/` location and edit all `.desktop` files that belong to Waydroid one by one.
    - What we are going to do while editing the files using a text editor is adding `NoDisplay=true` at the end of the `[Desktop Entry]` section of each `.desktop` file that belongs to Waydroid.
- After saving the changes, the icons should be hidden from your applications list after a few minutes. Removing the .desktop files would not work because they would be added again after running Waydroid.
- These are all we can do to install and configure Waydroid!
